# Project Details

Sample code can be found in [code_samples.rkt](./code_samples.rkt). More examples of constraints can be found in [test_stan_constraints.rkt](./test_stan_constraints.rkt). Additional, examples of constraints can be found in [test_stan_environment.rkt](./test_stan_environment.rkt).

Outside of those examples, every file with `stan_` has a corresponding `test_stan_`. It's been set up so everything is meant to be independent to make it easier to look through the code. If you want to run all tests at once you can use [test_all.rkt](./test_all.rkt).
